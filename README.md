 - In the output above, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to the results, vehicle lenght and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words the vehicle weight and ground clearance have a significant impact to the mpg values.
 - The slope of the linear model is NOT considered to be zero, because the p-value is 5.35e-11, which is more modest than the critical degree of 0.05% and furthermore gives adequate proof to dismiss the invalid speculation.
 - This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively becaused its Multiple R-squared is 0.7149, which implies the mpg expectations will be dictated by this model.
