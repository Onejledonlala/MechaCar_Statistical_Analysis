 - In the output above, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to the results, vehicle lenght and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words the vehicle weight and ground clearance have a significant impact to the mpg values.
 - The slope of the linear model is NOT considered to be zero, because the p-value is 5.35e-11, which is more modest than the critical degree of 0.05% and furthermore gives adequate proof to dismiss the invalid speculation.
 - This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively becaused its Multiple R-squared is 0.7149, which implies the mpg expectations will be dictated by this model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Based on the statistical insight shown above, the MechaCar suspension coils a general variance of 62.29. This doesn't exceed 100 pounds per square inch, which meets the necessities determinations for the MechaCar suspension curls.

However, out of the individual lots statistics, Lot3 exceeds the benchmark by over 70.29 which does not meet the necessary design specification. Lot1 and Lot2 are fine showing its an acceptable variance of 0.99 and 7.50 respectively. The image below shows the individual variances, as well as other satistical results
